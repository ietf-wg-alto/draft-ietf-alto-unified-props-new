# Definitions and Concepts

<!-- FIXME:
Please add some text on the concepts and their motivation before diving into
technical specifications. Even if the Introduction has some, the goal is to
explain to implementors when and why this extension is useful. See
suggestions in the text and attached txt file.
-->

## Entity

<!-- FIXME:
This section introduces a new concept and deserves more explanations before
diving in the technical "how to handle".
For instance:
- what kind of object other than an addressable ALTO endpoint is eligible to be
  an ALTO entity?
- an entity must be related to network address(es) e.g. entity such as PID, ASN
  nb, Country code have a defined mapping to IP or cellular addresses.
-->

The entity concept generalizes the concept of the endpoint defined in Section 2.1 of
[](#RFC7285). An entity is an object that can be an endpoint and is identified
by its network address, but can also be an object that has a defined mapping to
a set of one or more network addresses or is even not related to any network
address.

Examples of eligible entities are:

- a PID, defined in [](#RFC7285), that has a provider defined human readable
  abstract identifier and maps to a set of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses;
- an autonomous system (AS), that has an AS number (ASN) as its identifier 
  and maps to a set of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses;
- a region representing a country, that is identified by its country code defined 
  by ISO 3166, maps to a set of cellular addresses, and is an example that all endpoints 
  are entities while not all entities are endpoints;
- a TCP/IP network flow, that has a server defined identifier consisting of the 
  defining TCP/IP 5-Tuple;
- a routing element, that is specified in [](#RFC7921) and includes routing
  capability information;
- an abstract network element, that has a server defined identifier and
  represents a network node, link or their aggregation.

<!--
An entity is an object with a (possibly empty) set of properties.
It MAY or MAY NOT be related to a network address. There are a lot of examples
of entities, such as applications or end-hosts in a communication network, cells
in a wireless network, network flows, network functions, routing elements in a
routing system or even general network elements.
-->

<!-- TODO: Examples of entities -->

<!--
Each entity MUST be in one and only one domain, such as the IPv4 domain, the
IPv6 domain or PID domain (defined in this document), and has a unique identifier.
-->

## Entity Domain

Each entity MUST be in one and only one entity domain, where an entity domain is defined as a set
of entities. This document defines two entity domains for the Internet address domains (see
[](#inet-addr-domain)) and one entity domain for the PID domain (see [](#pid-domain)). Future
documents can define additional entity domains to satisfy their additional requirements
such as cellular network information and routing capability exposure. But they
are not in the scope of this document.

<!-- This document will define the domains precisely below. -->
<!-- An additional example is the proposed domain of Abstract Network Elements
associated with topology and routing, as suggested by
[](#I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector). -->

## Entity Domain Name {#domain-names}

Each entity domain MUST has a unique entity domain name, which MUST be no more than 32
characters, and MUST NOT contain characters other than US-ASCII alphanumeric
characters (U+0030-U+0039, U+0041-U+005A, and U+0061-U+007A), hyphen ('-',
U+002D), and low line ('\_', U+005F). For example, the names `ipv4` and `ipv6`
identify two Internet address entity domains (see [](#inet-addr-domain)). When there is no
confusion with the term domain names in domain systems (FIXME: add DNS reference), we use
the shorter domain name instead of the longer entity domain name.

The type EntityDomainName is used in this document to denote a JSON string confirming to the 
preceding requirement.

Each Entity Domain name MUST be registered with the IANA. The format of the entity
addresses (see [](#entity-addrs)) in that entity domain, as well as any
hierarchical or inheritance rules (see [](#def-hierarchy-and-inheritance)) for
those entities, MUST be specified at the same time.

## Entity Address {#entity-addrs}

<!-- FIXME: The entity identifier is not global unique. -->

FIXME: Entity Identifier => Entity Address DomainEntityAddr to be the same as 7285

revise to use the same notation, Type attr. Currently mixed up. EntityID defines
the type; Later entity identifier defines a set of entities (or inheritance?)

Following the same format as TypedEndpointAddr defined in 7285, 

Each entity has an entity identifier (EntityId) of the format:

<!-- TODO: Replace all entity address to entity identifier -->

``` text
    EntityId ::= EntityDomainName : DomainSpecificEntityId
```

An entity identifier uniquely identifies a particular entity within an ALTO
property map resource (see [](#prop-map)). FIXME, wrong

Examples from the Internet address entity domains include individual IP addresses such as
`ipv4:192.0.2.14` and `ipv6:2001:db8::12`, as well as address blocks such as
`ipv4:192.0.2.0/26` and `ipv6:2001:db8::1/48`.

The format of the second part of an entity identifier depends on the entity
domain, and MUST be specified when registering a new entity domain. Identifiers
MAY be hierarchical, and properties MAY be inherited based on that hierarchy.
Again, the rules defining any hierarchy or inheritance MUST be defined when the
entity domain is registered.

The type EntityId is used in this document to denote a JSON string representing an
entity identifier in this format.

Note that two entity identifiers with different textual representations may refer to the
same entity, for a given entity domain. For example, the strings `ipv6:2001:db8::1` and
`ipv6:2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1` refer to the same entity in the 'ipv6' entity domain.

## Property Type and Property Name {#def-property-type}

<!-- FIXME: Section needs be reorganized to first motivate the attachment of
address to address domain before setting rules. -->

Every entity in an entity domain MAY have one or more properties. Every property
is identified by a Property Type and is specific to the entity domain. Every property
MUST have a unique Property Type. FIXME: not MAY, mixed up name and type

<!-- OLD-0 -->
<!--
This document defines property types in the domain-specific semantics. This
design is to enforce that each property type MUST be registered for a single
specific entity domain. But multiple property types with the similar semantics
MAY share the same Property Name in different entity domains. This design
decision is adopted because of the following considerations:
-->

<!-- NEW-0 -->
This document defines property types in the domain-specific semantics. Multiple
property types with similar semantics MAY share the same Property Name in
different entity domains. But each property type MUST be registered for a single
specific entity domain for the following reasons: FIXME: bad wording

- Some properties may only be applicable for particular entity domains, not
  all. For example, the `pid` property is not applicable to entities in the
  `pid` domain, but is applicable to  entities in the `ipv4` or
  `ipv6` domains.
- The interpretation of the value of a property may depend on the entity domain.
  For different entity domains, not only the intended semantics but also the
  dependent FIXME resource types may be totally different. For example, suppose that
  the `geo-location` property is defined as the coordinatesof a point, encoded
  as (say) "latitude longitude [altitude]." When applied to an entity that
  represents a specific host computer, identified by an address in the ipv4 or
  ipv6 domain, the property defines the host's location and has no required
  dependency. However, when applied to an entity in the `pid` domain, the
  property would indicate the location of the center of all hosts in this `pid`
  entity and depend on the Network Map defining this `pid` entity.

Therefore, each property type has a unique identifier encoded with the
following format: FIXME type vs name vs property

``` text
PropertyType ::= EntityDomainName : PropertyName
```

- The `EntityDomainName` indicates which entity domain the property type applies
  to.
- The `PropertyName` SHOULD relate to the semantics of this property type. It
  does not have to be globally unique. In other words, different property types
  could have the same property name applied to different entity domains, if
  they have the similar semantics. For example, the property types `ipv4:pid`
  and `ipv6:pid` have the same property name `pid` applied to both `ipv4` and
  `ipv6` domains.

Property types MUST be registered with the IANA, and the intended semantics, as
well as the media types of dependent resources and the interpretation, MUST be
specified at the same time.

<!-- ## Property Name ## -->

<!-- FIXME: This is not correct. Because the ALTO entity domain is not a strict
superset of the ALTO address type. Revise it! -->

<!--
The space of entity property names associated with entities defined by this
document is a superset of the endpoint property names defined by [](#RFC7285).
Thus endpoint property names registered with the `ALTO Endpoint Property Type
Registry` MUST be defined in [](#IANAEndpointProp) of this document. The type
PropertyName denotes a JSON string with a property name in this format.
-->

<!-- FIXED: Change the single name space design to the domain-specific design -->

CHANGE BACK below:
<!--
This document defines uniform property names specified in a single property
name space rather than being scoped by a specific entity domain, although some
properties may only be applicable for particular entity domains. This design
decision is to enforce a design so that similar properties are named similarly.
The interpretation of the value of a property, however, may depend on the
entity domain. (FIXME: This design decision will mess up the dependency
declaration.) For example, suppose that the `geo-location` property is defined
as the coordinates of a point, encoded as (say) "latitude longitude
[altitude]." When applied to an entity that represents a specific host
computer, such as an Internet address, the property defines the host's
location.  When applied to an entity that represents a set of computers, such
as a CIDR, the property would be the location of the center of that set.  If it
is necessary to represent the bounding box of a set of hosts, another property,
such as `geo-region`, should be defined.
-->

## Hierarchy and Inheritance {#def-hierarchy-and-inheritance}

Entities in a given domain MAY form a hierarchy based on entity identifiers, and
introducing hierarchy allows the introduction of inheritance. Each entity domain
MUST define its own hierarchy and inheritance rules when registered. The
hierarchy and inheritance rule makes it possible for an entity to inherit a
property value from another entity in the same domain.
<!--If and only
if the property of an entity is undefined, the hierarchy and inheritance rules
are applied. [YRY: Do we need this?] [Jensen: I think this feature is for reducing the response size.] -->

## Relationship with Other ALTO Resources {#def-relationship-to-other-resources}

<!-- FIXME: very hard to grab the new rationale, needs re-phrasing. Pls see in
text. For instance, some confusion between relation between prop name and
domain and prop value and resource. -->

[](#RFC7285) recognizes that some properties for some entity domains MAY be
specific to an ALTO resource, such as a network map. Accordingly Section 10.8.1
of [](#RFC7285) defines the concept of `resource-specific endpoint properties`,
and indicates that dependency by prefixing the property name with the ID of the
resource on which it depends. That document defines one resource-specific
property, namely the `pid` property, whose value is the name of the PID
containing that endpoint in the associated network map.

<!-- OLD-1 -->
<!--
This document takes a different approach. Instead of defining the dependency by
qualifying the property name, this document attaches the dependency to the
entity domains. Thus each resource-specific property of all entities in a
specific domain depends on the same resources; the properties of entities in
another domain may depend on another resource. For example, in a single property
map, the `pid` property of all entities in an Internet address domain MUST
depend on the same network map. Each property of all entities in the PID domain
MUST also depend on a network map; but different properties may depend on
different network maps.
-->

<!-- NEW-1 -->
<!--
Because a property may be associated to more than one information resources
within an entity domain, this document takes a different approach as follows:
-->
<!--
However, considering the unified properties, the approach of
`resource-specific properties` has issues for several reasons:
-->

However, A property may be associated to more than one information resources
within an entity domain. For example, the fictitious property
`pid:cdni-fci-capabilities` indicates CDNI capabilities (see [](#RFC8008)) of a
set of `ipv4` or `ipv6` typed CDNI footprints included by some entities in PID
domain. It depends on two resources:

- the network map in which the input PID entities have been defined,
- the fictitious CDNI FCI map in which the CDNI footprints and capabilities
  advertisement objects (see [](#RFC8008)) are included.

A `resource-specific property` can only indicate one of them. Thus, using
`resource-specific properties` cannot handle multiple dependencies very well.

<!--
- Mixing properties depending on different resources is unnecessary.
- [](#RFC7285) already proposes the `uses` attribute to indicate resource dependencies.
-->

To address this issue, this document takes a different approach as follows:

- Firstly, instead of defining the dependency by prefixing the property name
  with a specific dependent resource identifier, this document introduces a
  Property Type that appends a property name to an entity domain name, and
  registers the dependency types for this Property Type. This gives a hint on
  the types of dependent resources. For example, the fictitious property
  `pid:region` applying to entities in the PID domain depends on the network map
  in which the input PID entities have been defined; but the fictitious property
  `ipv4:region` applying to entities in IPv4 domain does not depend on any
  information resource.
- Secondly, it sets a rule saying that in a property map, all provided property
  types MUST have the same media types of dependent information resources
  (denoted as "dependency types" in short). For example, the fictitious
  property types `pid:region` and `ipv4:region` cannot be provided in the same
  property map, as they have different dependency types.
- Finally, it identifies, in the IRD and Server responses, the sequence of
  information resources associated to all provided properties of entities in a
  particular property map. In other words, the ALTO server MUST NOT mix
  properties depending on different resources into the same resources, even if
  they have the same dependency types. There are two kinds of examples:

  - Assume there are a set of entities in IPv4 and IPv6 domain, and all of them
    have the property `pid`. The `pid` properties of entities in IPv4 domain
    depend on the network map `net1`, but the `pid` properties of entities in
    IPv6 domain depend on another network map `net2`. Although the property
    types `ipv4:pid` and `ipv6:pid` have the same dependency type sequence
    `["application/alto-networkmap+json"]`, the ALTO server cannot put them into
    the same property map.
  - Assume there are a set of entities in IPv4 domain, and each of them have two
    `pid` properties. One `pid` property depends on the network map `net1`, the
    other `pid` property depends on another network map `net2`. To distinguish
    them, the ALTO server can provide two `resource-specific endpoint
    properties` called `pid.net1` and `pid.net2` for each IPv4 entities in the
    same endpoint property map. But using the property map service defined in
    this document, the ALTO server has to define two individual property maps.
    Both property maps provide the property type `ipv4:pid`, but one depends on
    `net1` and the other one depends on `net2`.

<!--
This document takes a different approach. Instead of defining the dependency by
qualifying the property name, this document attaches the dependency to the
entity domains. Thus all properties of a specific entity domain depend on the
same resources (see below); the properties of another entity domain may depend on another
resource. For example, entities in the PID domain depend on a network map.
-->

<!-- OLD-2 -->
<!--
Specifically, this document uses the `uses` and `dependent-vtags` fields defined
in Sections 9.1.5 and 11.1 of [](#RFC7285), respectively, to specify the
preceding dependency: the `uses` field of an IRD entry providing entity domain
related resources (see Property Map and Filtered Property Map resources below)
specifies the dependent resources, and the `dependent-vtags` field specifies
dependency in message responses.
-->

<!-- NEW-2 -->
To specify the aforementionned dependencies, this document uses the "uses" and
"dependent-vtags" fields defined respectively in Sections 9.1.5 and 11.1 of
[RFC7285].

- the "uses" field is included in the IRD entry of a resources-dependent
  information resource and specifies the dependent IRD resource.
- the "dependent-vtags" member is used in a Server response message to specify
  the dependent resource.
