This document extends the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
Protocol by generalizing the concept of "endpoint properties" as applied to
endpoints as defined by IP addresses to endpoints defined by a wider set of
objects. Further, these properties are presented as maps, similar to the
network and cost maps in the base ALTO protocol. The protocol is extended in
two major directions. First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to
entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from
properties on specific endpoints to entire entity property maps. These
extensions introduce additional features allowing entities and property
values to be specific to a given information resource. This is made possible
by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types.
